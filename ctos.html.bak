          </div>
          * Direct Messages to my art Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/EveyWorlds">@EveyWorlds</a>
          are preferred, if you do not have a Twitter I can be contacted at my
          main Tumblr <a href="http://scketchtoomblur.tumblr.com/">
            scketchtoomblur</a>. <br>
          * If you do not have either Twitter or Tumblr, I can be contacted with
          my Discord Evil Sonic#0621. <br>
          * I prefer using more instant methods of communication like the ones
          above, but if you do <b>NOT </b>have <b>ANY </b>of the above then
          you can email me at Hyper_Evil_Sonic(at)msn(dot)com (<b>THIS IS NOT MY
            PAYPAL EMAIL</b>). <br>
          * Allow at least 24 hours for a response before you change your mind,
          thank you.

          </div>
          * <b>NO NSFW</b> at all, sorry. <br>
          * Cartoon violence is okay. <br>
          * Do not commission someone else to edit the art I made for you, if
          you'd like an edit after the commission is over (not only right after,
          but days, months, etc after) we can work out a deal (extra pay). <br>
          * I can draw anthropomorphic animals and humans! <br>
          * I cannot draw detailed robots, but I can draw robots that do not
          have much detail. <br>
          * No hate art of any kind. <br>
          * I can refuse your request. <br>
          * Be patient and properly articulate what you want. <br>
          * Commissions are usually done in the order they are received, you can
          see my slots and where you are at my Trello board. <br>
          * Comics can take longer than the other options, so please be more
          patient with them. <br>
          * Be respectful of the terms. <br>
          * Do not try to pay me to finish someone else's artwork.

              id="three">III. PAYMENT AND REFUNDS</h2>
          </div>
          * Please use commiss.io to commission me, my name there is
          EveyHedgehog. You do not need an account there to commission me. <br>
          * If you absolutely cannot use commiss.io for whatever reason, contact
          me and give me a valid email so I can send a Paypal invoice. <b>DO
            NOT</b> send money to my Paypal, let me send an invoice. <br>
          * If you do <b>NOT</b> use commiss.io, I won't start working until
          you pay me. <br>
          * If you do want a refund, please contact me first before attempting a
          chargeback to see if we can work it out. <br>
          * Full refunds are only issued during the sketch phase, <b>DO NOT</b>
          try to refund after I give you a sketch and then pay someone else to
          finish it or claim ownership of the sketch. <br>
          * Half refunds are only issued after I've shown you flats. No more
          refunds once I start shading. <br>
          * Uncolored doodles are not refundable, since they're practically just
          sketches. <br>
          * <b>FOR COMICS</b>: Full refunds are only issued during the
          thumbnail phase. We can work out refunds after other processes, but it
          can't be 100% after thumbnails are accepted.

          </div>
          *<b> IF YOU DO NOT USE COMMISS.IO</b> you<b> HAVE</b> to keep in
          contact with me thoughout the entire process. <br>
          * Be sure to pay attention to your email when you use commiss.io, so
          you can get updates. <br>
          * When I send images you have to give me your consent that you are
          happy with what you see, from start to end. Do not be vague. <br>
          * It is okay to request changes during the process. After <b>4 MAJOR
            changes</b> I may require an extra fee for each change afterwards. <br>
          * If a change requires the entire drawing to be redrawn after it has
          been colored there will be an extra fee.
