Fifth panel: The announcer announces, &quot;Congratulations participant!&quot; Sopraan continues looking back and sees the portal stretching out, creating a new opening. Sixth panel: The announcer exclaims, &quot;Enjoy your boat ride and have fun!&quot; as the portal completely opens, revealing a boat shaped like a sea-monster."><img
